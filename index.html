			<h2>Mercedes Benz</h2>
				<p>Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
				My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
				Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
				So, oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?</p>
				<p>Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?
				Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me
				I wait for delivery each day until three
				So, oh, Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?</p>
				<p>Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?
				I'm counting on you Lord, please don't let me down
				Prove that you love me and buy the next round
				Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town?</p>
				<p>Everybody</p>
				<p>Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?
				My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
				Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
				So, oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?</p>
